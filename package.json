These libraries can be used in any web application to: - verify the integrity and timestamp of any data anchored on the Bitcoin blockchain (so called DAB) by Woleet or by any third party using [Chainpoint 1.0](http://www.chainpoint.org/#v1x) compatible anchoring receipts, - compute the SHA256 hash of any file (even larger than 50MB).",
